 *
 * To use it, copy it to a file ending in "Test.php", e.g., "ExploratoryTest.php", so PHPUnit will find it. In order
 * to avoid dirtying the Git working directory or accidentally committing throwaway tests, all files except this one in
 * this directory are Git ignored. To commit a test permanently to the codebase, move it to a more appropriate location.
