 * This precondition is fulfilled unless BOTH the host is Windows AND the codebase contains symlinks.
 *
 * This includes both the active and staging directories.
 *
 * It doesn't matter whether the given directories actually exist. In order to isolate failures and avoid redundancy,
 * that question is left to its own preconditions. Except in the event of an IO error (which will throw an exception
 * according to the relevant interface), this one cares about literally nothing else if it doesn't actually find a
 * link on a Windows host.
 *
